         <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            
             <h3>How does COVID-19 spread?</h3>
                    <p>The virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, typically within 1 metre (short-range). A person can be infected when aerosols or droplets containing the virus are inhaled or come directly into contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>
            
            <h3>Can COVID-19 enter into the body by the hands?</h3>
                <p>Hands touch too many surfaces and can quickly pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your face, from where the virus can move inside your body, making you feel unwell</p>
            
            
            <h3>What does COVID-19 stand for?</h3>
                <p>'CO' stands for corona, 'VI' for virus, and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as '2019 novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV.' The COVID-19 virus is a new virus linked to the same family of viruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and some types of common cold.</p>
            
            <h3>Does COVID-19 infections have long term effects?</h3>
                <p>Most people recover from the acute phase of the disease. However, some people continue to experience a range of effects for months after recovery and damage to organs has been observed. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.</p>
